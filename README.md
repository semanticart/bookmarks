# Bookmarks

This is just me playing around with umbrella projects & elixir. Try not to draw any conclusions about

- elixir
- best practices
- me

:)

The goal is to have an umbrella project with

- a data app for reading/writing bookmarks
- a cli app that uses the data app
- a web app that uses the data app
